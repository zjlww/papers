What is unsupervised disentanglement?
> The key idea behind the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations is that real-world data is generated by a few explanatory factors of variation which can be recovered by unsupervised learning algorithms.

What is the formal definition of disentanglement?
> While there is no single formalized notion of disentanglement (yet) which is widely accepted, the key intuition is that a disentangled representation should separate the distinct, informative factors of variations in the data (Bengio et al., 2013). A change in a single underlying factor of variation zi should lead to a change in a single factor in the learned representation r(x).

Some works in VAE assume that encouraging factorization improves disentanglement.

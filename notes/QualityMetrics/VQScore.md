The idea is basically:
> To solve this problem, we propose VQScore, a self-supervised metric for evaluating speech based on the quantization error of a vector-quantizedvariational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The training of VQ-VAE relies on clean speech; hence, large quantization errors can be expected when the speech is distorted.

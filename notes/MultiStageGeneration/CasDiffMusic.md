Super cool demo. Implemented with html-midi-player.

Here is the network architecture:

> Similar to Min et al. (2023), we adopt 2D-UNet with cross-attention as the backbone neural architecture for all four levels of the generation with several modifications. First, the input channels are increased to allow background condition. Second, autoregressive and external conditions are fed through cross-attention layers.
